# CSSBaseline

The `CSSBaseline` component normalizes styles using [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) that provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements.

- Preserves useful defaults, unlike many CSS resets.
- Normalizes styles for a wide range of elements.
- Corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies.
- Improves usability with subtle modifications.
- Explains what code does using detailed comments.

## Import

```js
import CSSBaseline from '@trendmicro/react-styled-ui/CSSBaseline';
// or
import { CSSBaseline } from '@trendmicro/react-styled-ui';
```

## Usage

```jsx disabled
<>
  <CSSBaseline />
  <App />
</>
```

## Notes

- `box-sizing` is set globally on the `html` element to `border-box`. Every element including `*::before` and `*::after` will inherit this property, which ensures that the width of the element is never exceeded due to padding or border.
- No font size is declared on `<html>`, but 16px is assumed as the browser default.
- Base font family is declared on `<html>`:
  ```
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  ```
- Monospaced font family is delcared on `<pre>`, `<code>`, `<kbd>`, and `<samp>`:
  ```
  font-family: "SFMono-Medium", "SF Mono", "Segoe UI Mono", Menlo, Consolas, Courier, monospace;
  ```
