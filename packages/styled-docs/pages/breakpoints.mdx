# Breakpoints

To configure the default breakpoints used in responsive array values, add a
breakpoints array to your theme. These values will be used to generate
mobile-first (i.e. min-width) media queries, which can then be used to apply
responsive styles. 

> The `breakpoints` array which is used at breakpoints theme scale.

> For example, you can write `<Box fontSize={["xs", "sm"]}/>` to make the font size responsive.

<ThemeParser theme="breakpoints" />

```jsx
// responsive font size
<Box fontSize={["xs", "sm", "md", "lg"]}>Trend Micro</Box>
```

## Configuration reference

Except for breakpoints, colors, and spacing, all of the keys in the theme object
map to one of our core theme. All of these keys can be replaced or
extended.
