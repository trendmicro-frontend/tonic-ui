# Contributing to Documentation Site

Visit [this page](../contributing#set-up-documentation-site) for instructions on setting up the development environment for the documentation site.

## Overview

Let's get started by exploring the `pages` directory, which follows the Next.js convention where each directory or file represents a route in the application. Here is the directory structure:

Name | Description
:--- | :----------
404.page.js | Handles the 404 error page, displayed when a route is not found.
_app.page.js | A custom `App` component that controls the page initialization and creates a shared layout between page changes.
_document.page.js | A custom `Document` component that allows you to modify the initial HTML document structure. You can configure the `<html>` and `<body>` tags, set up meta tags, or add scripts and styles necessary for server-side rendering.
[getting-started/](../getting-started/usage) | Contains the getting started guide for Tonic UI.
[patterns/](../patterns) | Contains documentation on design patterns and best practices for Tonic UI.
[components/](../components) | Contains documentation for Tonic UI React components: `@tonic-ui/react`
[hooks/](../hooks) | Contains documentation for Tonic UI React Hooks: `@tonic-ui/react-hooks`
[icons/](../icons) | Contains documentation for Tonic UI React Icons: `@tonic-ui/react-icons`
[styled-system/](../styled-system) | Contains documentation for Tonic UI Styled System: `@tonic-ui/styled-system`
[theme/](../theme) | Contains documentation for Tonic UI theme: `@tonic-ui/theme`
[playground/](../playground) | Demonstrates how to create interactive applications with Tonic UI.

> Tip: Page extensions should be either `.page.js` or `.page.mdx`; otherwise, they will be treated as non-page files. If you need to use other page extensions, you can configure them in `next.config.js`.

To add a new page to the side navigation menu, modify `packages/react-docs/config/sidebar-routes.js` to add a route path to the speicifc page:

```js
const routes = [
  title: 'Main Section',
  icon: (props) => <MyIcon {...props} />,
  routes: [
    {
      title: 'Component Overview',
      path: 'path/to/component',
    },
  ],
];
```

## Writing React Component API Documentation

A typical React Component API documentation has the following sections:
* Heading
* Import
* Usage
* Props

### Heading

The heading includes the component name and a brief description of its purpose and functionality.

````mdx
# Box

`Box` is a fundamental building block that allows you to control styling using style props to build a variety of components.
````

### Import

Specifies how to import the component into your project. This section provides the exact import statement needed.

````mdx
## Import

```js
import { Box } from '@tonic-ui/react';
```
````

### Usage

Component usage examples demonstrate how to implement the component in your code. This section may include multiple examples showcasing different features or common use cases.

````mdx
## Usage

### Using the `as` prop

By default, the `Box` component renders a `div` element. There might be cases where you want to render a different element, you can use the `as` prop to do that.

{render('./using-the-as-prop')}
````

For the example above, add a `using-the-as-prop.js` file in the same directory:

````jsx
import { Box } from '@tonic-ui/react';
import React from 'react';

const App = () => (
  <Box as="button">
    Button
  </Box>
);

export default App;
````

### Props

The API props section details all the properties that the component accepts. It includes the following information for each prop:
* **Name**: The name of the prop.
* **Type**: The expected data type of the prop (e.g., string, number, boolean, object, function, ElementType, ReactNode).
* **Default Value**: The default value if the prop is not provided.
* **Description**: A brief description of what the prop does and how it affects the component.

## Props

### Box

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |
| as | string \| ElementType | 'div' | |
| children | ReactNode | | |
