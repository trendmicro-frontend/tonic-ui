# Contributing to React Icons

The `@tonic-ui/react-icons` package relies on an exact version of the `@trendmicro/tmicon` package to generate icons. It is essential to explicitly specify the required version in the `devDependencies` for icon generation process.

To update icons in https://github.com/trendmicro-frontend/tmicon, please contact the repository owner to request a new release.

## Updating Dependencies

1. Navigate to the `packages/react-icons` directory in your local repository.

2. Modify the `package.json` file and update the `@trendmicro/tmicon` package to the specified version under `devDependencies`. For example:

```js
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@trendmicro/tmicon": "1.40.0"
  }
}
```

## Generating Icons

Once you have updated the `package.json` file, follow these steps to update dependencies and generate the icons. This process uses the specified version of `@trendmicro/tmicon` to ensure all icons are built correctly.

2. Run `generate-icons` script to generate icons:
