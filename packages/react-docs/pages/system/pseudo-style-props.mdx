# Pseudo Style Props

Styling elements with [pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) and [pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) can be accomplished by prefixing the pseudo selector with one or two underscores (`_` for pseudo-classees or `__` for pseudo-elements).

For example, to style the element with `:hover` pseudo-class, you can use `_hover`.

```jsx
<Text
  _hover={{ // same as ':hover'
    color: 'blue:50',
    cursor: 'pointer',
    textDecoration: 'underline',
  }}
>
  Hover Me
</Text>
```

To style the element with `::firstLine` pseudo-element, you can use `__firstLine`.

```jsx
<Text
  __firstLine={{ // same as '::first-line'
    color: 'blue:50',
    textTransform: 'uppercase',
  }}
>
  This is line 1<br/>
  This is line 2<br/>
  This is line 3<br/>
</Text>
```
