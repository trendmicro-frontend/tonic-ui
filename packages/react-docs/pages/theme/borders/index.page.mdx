# Borders

## Design Tokens

<ThemeParser theme="borders" />

## Examples

The border shorthand property sets all the border properties in one declaration.

```js
/* style */
border="solid"

/* width | style */
border="2px dotted"

/* style | color */
border="outset #f33"

/* width | style | color */
border="medium dashed green"

/* Global values */
border="inherit"
border="initial"
border="unset"
```

The `border` property may be specified using one, two, or three of the values listed below. The order of the value does not matter. See [border](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border) in MDN for more details.

Note: The border will be invisible if its style is not defined. This is because the style defaults to `none`.

### Values

`<border-color>`
Sets the color of the border. Defaults to `currentcolor` if absent.

`<border-style>`
Sets the style of the border. Defaults to `none` if absent.

`<border-width>`
Sets the thickness of the border. Defaults to `medium` if absent.

### Nonnegative length

If the border is a numeric value defined in the theme, the `solid` border style will be applied as a shorthand for the `borderWidth` and `borderStyle` properties.

{render('./borders-numeric-value')}

### Keyword

`thin`, `medium`, and `thick` are keywords that indicate the border width. You can use them in the `border` property, but you have to set the `borderStyle` property to `solid` as well.

Note: Because the specification doesn't define the exact thickness denoted by each keyword, the precise result when using one of them is implementation-specific. Nevertheless, they always follow the pattern `thin ≤ medium ≤ thick`, and the values are constant within a single document.

{render('./borders-keyword')}

## Borders vs. Outlines

Borders and [outlines](./outlines) are very similar. However, outlines differ from borders in the following ways:

* Outlines never take up space, as they are drawn outside of an element's content.
* According to the spec, outlines don't have to be rectangular, although they usually are.
