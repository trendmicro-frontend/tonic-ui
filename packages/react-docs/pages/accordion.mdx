# Accordion

`Accordion` is used to display a list of high-level options that can expand/collapse to reveal more information.

### Accordion components

- `Accordion`: The wrapper that uses cloneElement to pass its prop to `AccordionItem`.
- `AccordionItem`: A single accordion item.
- `AccordionHeader`: It is used to toggle the expand/collapse state of the accordion item.
- `AccordionPanel`: The container for the details to be revealed.
- `AccordionIcon`: A `chevron-down` icon that rotates based on the expand/collapse state.

## Import

```js
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionHeader,
  AccordionPanel,
  AccordionIcon,
} from '@tonic-ui/react';
```

## Usage

By default, only one item may be expanded and it can only be collapsed again by
expanding another.

```jsx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionHeader>
      <Flex justifyContent="space-between">
        Section 1
        <AccordionIcon />
      </Flex>
    </AccordionHeader>
    <AccordionPanel>
      <Text whiteSpace="pre-wrap" p="3x">
        Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups.
      </Text>
    </AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionHeader>
      <Flex justifyContent="space-between">
        Section 2
        <AccordionIcon />
      </Flex>
    </AccordionHeader>
    <AccordionPanel>
      <Text whiteSpace="pre-wrap" p="3x">
        Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups.
      </Text>
    </AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### Expand multiple items at once

If you set `allowMultiple` to true, then the accordion will permit multiple items to be expanded at once.

If you pass this prop, ensure that the `index` or `defaultIndex` prop is an array.

```jsx
<Accordion
  defaultIndex={[0]}
  allowMultiple
>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionHeader>
      <Flex justifyContent="space-between">
        Section 1
        <AccordionIcon />
      </Flex>
    </AccordionHeader>
    <AccordionPanel>
      <Text whiteSpace="pre-wrap" p="3x">
        Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups.
      </Text>
    </AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionHeader>
      <Flex justifyContent="space-between">
        Section 2
        <AccordionIcon />
      </Flex>
    </AccordionHeader>
    <AccordionPanel>
      <Text whiteSpace="pre-wrap" p="3x">
        Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups.
      </Text>
    </AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### Toggle each accordion item

If you set `allowToggle` to true, any expanded item may be collapsed again.

```jsx
<Accordion allowToggle>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionHeader>
      <Flex justifyContent="space-between">
        Section 1
        <AccordionIcon />
      </Flex>
    </AccordionHeader>
    <AccordionPanel>
      <Text whiteSpace="pre-wrap" p="3x">
        Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups.
      </Text>
    </AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionHeader>
      <Flex justifyContent="space-between">
        Section 2
        <AccordionIcon />
      </Flex>
    </AccordionHeader>
    <AccordionPanel>
      <Text whiteSpace="pre-wrap" p="3x">
        Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups.
      </Text>
    </AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### Styling the expanded state

The `AccordionItem` component has the render prop `isExpanded` set to `true` or `false`.

```jsx
<AccordionItem>
  {({ isExpanded }) => (
    <>
      <AccordionHeader
        bg={isExpanded ? 'blue:80': 'blue:60'}
        _hover={{ bg: 'blue:70' }}
        _active={{ bg: 'blue:80' }}
        p="3x"
      >
        <Flex justifyContent="space-between">
          Click Me
          <AccordionIcon />
        </Flex>
      </AccordionHeader>
      <AccordionPanel>
        <Text whiteSpace="pre-wrap" p="3x">
          Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups.
        </Text>
      </AccordionPanel>
    </>
  )}
</AccordionItem>
```

### Accessing the internal state

If you need access to the internal state of each accordion item, you can use a
render prop. It provides 2 internal state: `isDisabled and `isExpanded`.

```jsx
<Accordion allowMultiple>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionHeader>
      <Flex justifyContent="space-between">
        Section 1
        <AccordionIcon />
      </Flex>
    </AccordionHeader>
    <AccordionPanel>
      <Text whiteSpace="pre-wrap" p="3x">
        Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups.
      </Text>
    </AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem>
    {({ isDisabled, isExpanded }) => (
      <>
        <AccordionHeader>
          <Flex justifyContent="space-between">
            Section 2
            <Icon
              icon={isExpanded ? 'minus' : 'add'}
              style={{
                opacity: isDisabled ? .4 : 1,
                transform: isExpanded ? null : 'rotate(-90deg)',
                transition: 'transform 0.2s',
                transformOrigin: 'center',
              }}
            />
          </Flex>
        </AccordionHeader>
        <AccordionPanel>
          <Text whiteSpace="pre-wrap" p="3x">
            Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups.
          </Text>
        </AccordionPanel>
      </>
    )}
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```
