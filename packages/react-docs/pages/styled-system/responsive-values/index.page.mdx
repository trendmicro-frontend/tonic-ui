# Responsive Values

The responsive values rely on the [breakpoints](../theme/breakpoints) defined in the theme configuration. The breakpoints are used to generate the media queries that make the theme responsive.

| Breakpoint | Media Query |
| :--------- | :---------- |
| `sm` | `@media screen and (min-width: 320px)` |
| `md` | `@media screen and (min-width: 640px)` |
| `lg` | `@media screen and (min-width: 1024px)` |
| `xl` | `@media screen and (min-width: 1280px)` |
| `2xl` | `@media screen and (min-width: 1680px)` |

To use the responsive values, you can use either the array or object syntax.

## Array Syntax

Let's say you have a `Box` component that looks like this:

```jsx disabled
<Box backgroundColor="red:50" width="50%">
  This is a box
</Box>
```

To make the `width` responsive, you can use the array syntax as follows:

```jsx disabled
<Box backgroundColor="red:50" width={["25%","50%","75%","100%"]}>
  This is a box
</Box>
```

Here is how to interpret the array syntax:

* On a `sm` breakpoint (`≥ 320px`), the `width` will be `25%`
* On a `md` breakpoint (`≥ 640px`), the `width` will be `50%`
* On a `lg` breakpoint (`≥ 1024px`), the `width` will be `75%`
* On a `xl` breakpoint (`≥ 1280px`), the `width` will be `100%`

> To skip certain breakpoints, you can pass `null` to any position in the array.

## Object Syntax (Recommended)

You can also use the object syntax to define responsive values. It's also the recommended syntax to use the responsive values.

Let's say you have a `Text` component that looks like this:

```jsx disabled
<Text fontSize={32}>
  This is a text
</Text>
```

To make the `fontSize` responsive, you can use the object syntax as follows:

```jsx disabled
<Text fontSize={{ _: 24, md: 32, lg: 40, xl: 48 }}>
  This is a text
</Text>
```

Here is how to interpret the object syntax:

* On a `sm` breakpoint (`≥ 320px`), the `fontSize` will be `24px`
* On a `md` breakpoint (`≥ 640px`), the `fontSize` will be `32px`
* On a `lg` breakpoint (`≥ 1024px`), the `fontSize` will be `40px`
* On a `xl` breakpoint (`≥ 1280px`), the `fontSize` will be `48px`

> You can use the `_` key to define a default value for all breakpoints.

## Under the Hood

Given the following example:

```jsx disabled
<Box width={{ _: '100%', sm: '50%', md: '25%' }}>
  This is a box
</Box>
```

It will generate the following CSS:

```css
.Box {
  width: 100%;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 320px) {
  .Box {
    width: 50%;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 640px) {
  .Box {
    width: 25%;
  }
}
```
