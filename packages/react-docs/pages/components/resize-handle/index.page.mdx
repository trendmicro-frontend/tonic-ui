# ResizeHandle

The `ResizeHandle` component is a tool designed to enhance the functionality of other components such as `Table` and `TreeView` by enabling smooth resizing of adjacent elements.

## Import

```js
import { ResizeHandle } from '@tonic-ui/react';
```

## Usage

* When hovering over the border of the resizable tree view, change the cursor to `col-resize` and highlight the border color to indicate that it is resizable. The hoverable area is `8px` in width, including the border.
* When dragging the resizable area, display a translucent background with a `4px` width (excluding the border) to indicate the dragging action.

{render('./resizable')}
