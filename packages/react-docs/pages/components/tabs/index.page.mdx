# Tabs

Tabs is used to group and display a set of related elements.

## Import

```js
import {
  Tab,
  Tabs,
  TabList,
  TabPanel,
  TabPanels,
  useTabs,
} from '@tonic-ui/react';
```

## Usage

### Basic tabs

Here is a basic example of tabs.

{render('./basic')}

> `TabList` and `TabPanels` are used to group the tabs and tab panels. If you don't need the tabs to be grouped, you can use `Tab` and `TabPanel` directly.<br/><br/>
> ```jsx disabled
> <Tabs>
>   <Tab>TAB 1</Tab>
>   <Tab>TAB 2</Tab>
>   <Tab>TAB 3</Tab>
>   <TabPanel>Tab Panel 1</TabPanel>
>   <TabPanel>Tab Panel 2</TabPanel>
>   <TabPanel>Tab Panel 3</TabPanel>
> </Tabs>
> ```

### Controlled and uncontrolled tabs

The `index` prop is used to control which tab is selected. The `onChange` callback returns the selected tab index whenever the user changes the tab. If you intend to control the tabs programmatically, use the `onChange` callback to update the `index` prop.

{render('./controlled')}

For uncontrolled tabs, you can use the `defaultIndex` prop to set the initial selected tab.

{render('./uncontrolled')}

### Orientation and variants

Tabs can either be oriented horizontally or vertically, and can also be styled with different variants.

* Use the `orientation` prop to set the orientation of the tabs. It accepts `horizontal` and `vertical` as values.
* Use the `variant` prop to set the variant of the tabs. It accepts `default`, `filled`, and `unstyled` as values.

{render('./orientation-variants')}

### Decorate horizontal tabs with a bottom border

To decorate horizontal tabs with a bottom border, you can pass `__after` prop to `TabList` to render a bottom border.

{render('./layout')}

### Access the state of tabs

Sometimes you need to access the state of tabs. For example, you may want to lazily load the content of a tab when that tab is selected.

`Tabs`, `Tab`, and `TabPanel` components expose internal state using **Function as Children (FaCC)**. This is not a recommended approach, but it is useful for this use case.

{render('./state')}

### Tabs with dropdown menus

The tab with the dropdown menu is usually the last tab. You can use `event.preventDefault()` to control whether the tab will be selected when the user clicks the dropdown menu.

{render('./dropdown-menu')}

### Draggable tabs with dropdown menus

Use [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) to make tabs draggable.

{render('./draggable')}

### Scrollable tabs

Scrollable tabs are useful when the tab list is longer than the tab container. You can use the following code to create a scrollable tabs.

> This example teaches you how to create a scrollable tabs that supports drag-to-scroll behavior. Scrolling tabs is currently not part of this component library.

{render('./scrollable')}

### Customization

Tabs also come with an `unstyled` variant. It's useful for doing customizations.

{render('./customization')}

## Accessibility

### [ARIA: tab role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/tab_role)

  > This example combines the role `tab` with `tablist` and elements with `tabpanel` to create an interactive group of tabbed content. Here we are enclosing our group of content in a `div`, with our `tablist` having an `aria-label` which labels it for assistive technology. Each `tab` is a `button` with the attributes previously mentioned. The first `tab` has both `tabindex="0"` and `aria-selected="true"` applied. These two attributes must always be coordinated as such—so when another tab is selected, it will then have `tabindex="0"` and `aria-selected="true"` applied. All unselected tabs must have `aria-selected="false"` and `tabindex="-1"`.<br/><br/>
  > All of the `tabpanel` elements have `tabindex="0"` to make them tabbable, and all but the currently active one have the `hidden` attribute. The `hidden` attribute will be removed when a `tabpanel` becomes visible with JavaScript. There is some basic styling applied that restyles the buttons and changes the `z-index` of `tab` elements to give the illusion of it connecting to the `tabpanel` for active elements, and the illusion that inactive elements are behind the active `tabpanel`.<br/><br/>
  > ```js
  > <div class="tabs">
  >   <div role="tablist" aria-label="Sample Tabs">
  >     <button role="tab" aria-selected="true" aria-controls="panel-1" id="tab-1" tabindex="0">
  >       First Tab
  >     </button>
  >     <button role="tab" aria-selected="false" aria-controls="panel-2" id="tab-2" tabindex="-1">
  >       Second Tab
  >     </button>
  >     <button role="tab" aria-selected="false" aria-controls="panel-3" id="tab-3" tabindex="-1">
  >       Third Tab
  >     </button>
  >   </div>
  >   <div id="panel-1" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0" aria-labelledby="tab-1">
  >     <p>Content for the first panel</p>
  >   </div>
  >   <div id="panel-2" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0" aria-labelledby="tab-2" hidden>
  >     <p>Content for the second panel</p>
  >   </div>
  >   <div id="panel-3" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0" aria-labelledby="tab-3" hidden>
  >     <p>Content for the third panel</p>
  >   </div>
  > </div>
  > ```

### [WAI-ARIA Roles, States, and Properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#tabpanel)

* The element that serves as the container for the set of tabs has role `tablist`.
* Each element that serves as a tab has role `tab` and is contained within the element with role `tablist`.
* Each element that contains the content panel for a `tab` has role `tabpanel`.
* If the tab list has a visible label, the element with role `tablist` has `aria-labelledby` set to a value that refers to the labelling element. Otherwise, the `tablist` element has a label provided by `aria-label`.
* Each element with role `tab` has the property `aria-controls` referring to its associated `tabpanel` element.
* The active `tab` element has the state `aria-selected` set to `true` and all other `tab` elements have it set to `false`.
* Each element with role `tabpanel` has the property `aria-labelledby` referring to its associated `tab` element.
* If a `tab` element has a popup menu, it has the property `aria-haspopup` set to either `menu` or `true`.
* If the `tablist` element is vertically oriented, it has the property `aria-orientation` set to `vertical`. The default value of `aria-orientation` for a `tablist` element is `horizontal`.
