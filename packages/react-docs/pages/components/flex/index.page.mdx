# Flex

`Flex` is a [`Box`](box) with `display: flex` and comes with helpful style shorthand props.

## Import

```js
import { Flex } from '@tonic-ui/react';
```

## Usage

Flex provides the following style shorthand props:

| Shorthand Prop | Style Prop | CSS Property | Description |
| :------------- | :--------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| align | alignItems | [align-items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items) | Sets the `align-self` value on all direct children as a group. |
| direction | flexDirection | [flex-direction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction) | Sets how flex items are placed in the flex container. |
| wrap | flexWrap | [flex-wrap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-wrap) | Sets whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines. |
| justify | justifyContent | [justify-content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content) | Defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main axis of a flex container. |

### Flex items

You can use the `flex` property to set how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit the available space in its flex container. It is a shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`. For most purposes, you should set `flex` to one of the following values: `auto`, `initial`, `none`, or a positive unitless number.

#### Values

##### `initial`
The item is sized according to its `width` and `height` properties. It shrinks to its minimum size to fit the container, but does not grow to absorb any extra free space in the flex container. This is equivalent to setting `flex: 0 1 auto`.

##### `auto`
The item is sized according to its `width` and `height` properties, but grows to absorb any extra free space in the flex container, and shrinks to its minimum size to fit the container. This is equivalent to setting `flex: 1 1 auto`.

##### `none`
The item is sized according to its `width` and `height` properties. It is fully inflexible: it neither shrinks nor grows in relation to the flex container. This is equivalent to setting `flex: 0 0 auto`.

To see the effect of these values, try resizing the flex containers below:

{render('./flex-none')}

### The `flexDirection` property

{render('./flex-direction')}

### The `flexWrap` property

{render('./flex-wrap')}

### The `alignItems` property

{render('./align-items')}

### The `justifyContent` property

{render('./justify-content')}
