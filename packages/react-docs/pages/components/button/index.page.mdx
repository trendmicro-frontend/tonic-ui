# Button

`Button` is used to trigger an action or event, such as submitting a form, opening a [`Modal`](modal), canceling an action, or performing a delete operation.

## Import

```js
import { Button } from '@tonic-ui/react';
```

## Usage

{render('./usage')}

### Variants

Use the `variant` prop to change the visual style of `Button`. You can set the value to `emphasis`, `primary`, `default`, `secondary`, or `ghost`.

{render('./variants')}

### Sizes

Use the `size` prop to change the size of the button. You can set the value to `sm`, `md`, or `lg`.

{render('./sizes')}

### States

You can make buttons look inactive or active by adding the `disabled` or `selected` prop. In either case, the button will not be clickable in disabled or selected state.

{render('./states')}

#### Disabled state

If the `disabled` prop is set (or set to `true`), the button will have a `disabled` attribute and not respond to user interactions.

```jsx disabled
<button type="button" disabled aria-disabled="true">Button</button>
```

To customize the visual appearance of the disabled state, pass the `_disabled` style prop to override the default style.

{render('./disabled-state')}

#### Selected state

If the `selected` prop is set (or set to `true`), the button will have both `pointer-events: none` style and `tabindex="-1"` attribute. This will prevent the button from receiving pointer events and will not be reachable via sequential keyboard navigation.

```jsx disabled
<button type="button" aria-selected="true" tabindex="-1">Button</button>
```

To customize the visual appearance of the selected state, pass the `_selected` style prop to override the default style.

{render('./selected-state')}

### Icons

Icons are commonly used in toolbar buttons. You can use the `columnGap` style prop or the [Space](space) component to adjust the spacing between the icon and the label.

{render('./icons')}

### Customization

To create a custom button, you can use the style props for the [ButtonBase](button-base) component.
