# Drawer

A drawer dialog is a window overlaid on either the primary window or another dialog
window. Contents behind a drawer dialog are **inert** meaning that users cannot
interact with content behind the dialog.

## Import

```js
import {
  Drawer,
  DrawerOverlay,
  DrawerContent,
  DrawerHeader,
  DrawerBody,
  DrawerFooter,
  DrawerCloseButton
  useDrawer,
} from '@tonic-ui/react';
```

## Usage

Click the button below to toggle a drawer. The drawer will show up on either side of the screen.

{render('./usage')}

### How to close a drawer

#### Using the `isClosable` prop to

The `isClosable` prop is used to make a drawer closable by adding a close button to it. By default, the value of `isClosable` is false. To make a drawer closable, set `isClosable` to true.

```jsx disabled
<Drawer isOpen={isOpen} isClosable onClose={onClose}>
  <DrawerOverlay />
  <DrawerContent>
    <DrawerHeader />
    <DrawerBody />
    <DrawerFooter />
  </DrawerContent>
</Drawer>
```

#### Using the `DrawerCloseButton` component

The `DrawerCloseButton` component provides an easy way to add a close button to a drawer. This button is specifically designed to handle closing the drawer, so you don't need to write any additional code to handle it. If you use `DrawerCloseButton`, you can omit the `isClosable` prop in the `Drawer` component.

Besides the default functionality of the `DrawerCloseButton`, you can also pass additional props, such as `data-test` or `data-tracking` attributes, to the `DrawerCloseButton` component as needed.

```jsx disabled
<Drawer isOpen={isOpen} onClose={onClose}>
  <DrawerOverlay />
  <DrawerContent>
    <DrawerHeader />
    <DrawerBody />
    <DrawerFooter />
    <DrawerCloseButton data-test="drawer-close-button" />
  </DrawerContent>
</Drawer>
```
