# Portal

A Portal is a declarative component that allows you to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. This is useful for rendering elements, such as drawers, modals, or popovers, above other elements in the document.

## Import

```js
import {
  Portal,
} from '@tonic-ui/react';
```

## Usage

To use the `Portal` component, you can wrap any element or component within it, and it will be rendered at the end of the document body.

{render('./portal')}

### Using a custom container

You can also specify a custom container for the portal to be rendered in by passing the `containerRef` prop and its value to the `ref` of the container element.

{render('./custom-container')}

### Nested portals

It is also possible to nest portals inside a parent portal. To do this, pass `appendToParentPortal={true}` to the nested portal. This will append the children of the nested portal to the container of the parent portal.

{render('./nested-portals')}

## Props

### Portal

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |
| appendToParentPortal | boolean | false | If `true`, the portal will check if it is within a parent portal and append itself to the parent's portal node. |
| children | ReactNode | | |
| containerRef | RefObject | | The `ref` to the component where the portal will be rendered. |
