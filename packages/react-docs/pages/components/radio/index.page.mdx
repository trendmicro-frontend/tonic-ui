# Radio

Radio buttons are used when only one choice may be selected in a series of options.

## Import

```js
import { Radio } from '@tonic-ui/react';
```

## Usage

{render('./basic')}

You can use a flex container to align a radio button with other components. This allows you to easily control the positioning and spacing of all elements within the container.

{render('./flex-container')}

### Colors

Use the `variantColor` prop to change the color scheme of a radio button. `variantColor` can be any color key with key `50` (hover) or `60` (checked) that exist in `theme.colors`.

{render('./colors')}

### Sizes

Use the `size` prop to change the radio button size. You can set the value to `sm`, `md`, or `lg`.

{render('./sizes')}

### States

{render('./states')}

## Accessibility

WAI-ARIA: https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radio/

* All form controls should have labels, and this includes radio buttons, checkboxes, and switches. In most cases, this is done by using the `<label>` element.
* When a label can't be used, it's necessary to add an attribute directly to the input component. In this case, you can apply the additional attribute (e.g. `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `title`) via the `inputProps` prop.

```jsx disabled
<Radio
  inputProps={{
    'aria-label': 'Label',
  }}
/>
```

## Commonly Asked Questions

### How to obtain and interact with the input element?

To access the input element within the `Radio` component, you can make use of the `inputRef` prop. This prop allows you to acquire a reference to the input element, enabling you to interact with it.

Once you have obtained the reference to the input element, you can access its properties and methods. For instance, you can use the `checked` property to retrieve the current checked state of the input element. Additionally, if you need to focus on the input element programmatically, you can utilize the `focus()` method available on the input element reference.

Here's an example of how you can utilize the `inputRef` prop to access the input element and perform actions:

{render('./faq-input-ref')}
