# Badge

Badges are used to highlight an item's status for quick recognition.

## Import

```js
import { Badge } from '@tonic-ui/react';
```

## Usage

### Basic badge

To display the badge on the top-right corner of the wrapped component, specify the `badgeContent` prop with the desired content.

{render('./basic')}

### Dot badge

Use `variant="dot"` to change a badge into a small dot. This can be used as a notification that something has changed without giving a count.

{render('./dot')}

### Standalone badge

The badge can be used as a standalone component. This can be useful for displaying a badge without a surrounding element.

{render('./standalone')}

### Badge alignment

You can use the `placement` prop to move the badge to any corner of the wrapped element. The default placement is `top-right`. The `placement` prop can be one of `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right`.

{render('./badge-alignment')}

### Badge visibility

The badge visibility can be controlled using the `isInvisible` prop.

{render('./badge-visibility')}

### Color

The color of the badge can be changed by passing the `backgroundColor` prop. See the [colors](../theme/colors) section to learn more about colors.

{render('./color')}

### Size

The size of the badge can be changed by passing the `height` and `minWidth` props.

{render('./size')}

### Customization

You can customize the badge style by passing style props. See the following example to learn how to create a outline badge.

{render('./customization')}
