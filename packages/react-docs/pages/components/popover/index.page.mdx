# Popover

`Popover` is a non-modal dialog that floats around a trigger. `Popover` is used to display contextual information to users, and should be paired with a clickable trigger element.

`Popover` is built on top of the [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) library, and is composed of the `Popper` component.

## Import

```js
import {
  Popover,
  PopoverArrow,
  PopoverTrigger,
  PopoverContent,
  PopoverHeader,
  PopoverBody,
  PopoverFooter,
  usePopover,
} from '@tonic-ui/react';
```

## Usage

To create an accessible popover, it should allow users to access it using the tab key on a keyboard. When it opens, the focus status will be set to `PopoverContent`. When it closes, the focus status will return to `PopoverTrigger`.

```jsx disabled
<Popover>
  <PopoverTrigger>
    <Button variant="secondary">
      Interactive Trigger
    </Button>
  </PopoverTrigger>
  <PopoverContent>
    <PopoverHeader>Popover Header</PopoverHeader>
    <PopoverBody>Popover Body</PopoverBody>
    <PopoverFooter>Popover Footer</PopoverFooter>
  </PopoverContent>
</Popover>
```

By default, you can only pass a single React element child to the `PopoverTrigger` component.

```jsx disabled
<PopoverTrigger>
  <Button variant="secondary">
    Interactive Trigger
  </Button>
</PopoverTrigger>
```

If you need to pass more than one child element or non-element children, wrap them in an element or pass the `shouldWrapChildren` prop.

```jsx disabled
<PopoverTrigger outline={0} tabIndex={-1}>
  <Text display="inline-block">
    Non-interactive Trigger
  </Text>
</PopoverTrigger>
```

```jsx disabled
<PopoverTrigger outline={0} shouldWrapChildren tabIndex={-1}>
  Non-interactive Trigger
</PopoverTrigger>
```

```jsx disabled
<PopoverTrigger outline={0} shouldWrapChildren tabIndex={-1}>
  <MenuIcon height="5x" mr="2x" />
  <Text display="inline-block">Non-interactive Trigger</Text>
</Popover>
```

📢 Please note that if you pass non-interactive elements to `PopoverTrigger`, it is important to set the `tabIndex` value. You can set either `-1` or `0`, and this will ensure that the `PopoverTrigger` component functions correctly. If you fail to set this value, the `PopoverTrigger` may not work as intended.

### Controlled and uncontrolled popover

Pass `isOpen` to the `Popover` component to control the state of the popover.

{render('./controlled')}

Popover is uncontrolled by default. You can set `defaultIsOpen` to `true` to have the popover open for the first render.

{render('./uncontrolled')}

### Focus control

#### Focus an element when popover opens

The focus status will send to `PopoverContent` when `Popover` opens. You can send the focus status to a specific element when it opens by passing the `initialFocusRef` prop.

{render('./focus-control-initial-focus-ref')}

#### Focus an element when popover closes

When the `Popover` is closed, the focus status is sent to the `PopoverTrigger`. If you need to prevent the `Popover` from returning the focus status to `PopoverTrigger`, you can set the `returnFocusOnClose` prop to `false`.

{render('./focus-control-return-focus-on-close')}

### Hide the popover

To hide a popover in your app, you can pass an empty value to the children of the `PopoverContent` component or use the `disabled` prop. Here are examples:

{render('./popover-disabled')}

### Hide the arrow of the popover

To remove the arrow from a popover, you can pass `arrow={false}` to the `Popover` component.

{render('./popover-arrow-disabled')}

### Popover around disabled button

By default the `Popover` is not shown when it is around a disabled `Button`.

{render('./popover-around-disabled-button')}

To show the `Popover` on a disabled `Button`, pass the `shouldWrapChildren` prop.

{render('./popover-around-wrapped-disabled-button')}

### Activating a popover on hover

To activate a popover on hover, set the `trigger` prop to `"hover"`. This will display the popover when a user hovers the cursor over the `PopoverTrigger`.

Once the popover is displayed, the cursor can be moved freely between the `PopoverTrigger` and `PopoverContent`. The popover will remain open until the cursor is moved away from the `PopoverContent`.

{render('./popover-trigger-hover')}

### Adjust popover positioning

#### Using the `offset` prop

The `offset` prop allows you to adjust the positioning of the popover by accepting an array of two numbers in the format `[skidding, distance]`.

**Skidding**

The `skidding` number determines the displacement of the `PopoverContent` from the `PopoverTrigger` and is measured in pixels.

**Distance**

The `distance` number controls the distance between the `PopoverContent` and the `PopoverTrigger` and is measured in pixels.

{render('./positioning-offset')}

#### Using the `nextToCursor` prop

The `nextToCursor` prop positions the popover next to the cursor.

Note that this prop only works when the `trigger` prop is set to `"hover"`.

{render('./positioning-next-cursor')}

#### Using the `followCursor` prop

The `followCursor` prop makes the popover follow the cursor as it moves.

Note that this prop only works when the `trigger` prop is set to `"hover"`.

{render('./positioning-follow-cursor')}

### Context API

To access the internal state of the popover, you can use the Function as Child Component (FaCC) pattern or use the `usePopover` hook.

{render('./function-as-child-component')}

### Placement

Use the `placement` prop to control the placement of the popover.

```jsx disabled
<Popover placement="top" trigger="hover">
  <PopoverTrigger>
    <LinkButton>Trigger</LinkButton>
  </PopoverTrigger>
  <PopoverContent>
    Popover
  </PopoverContent>
</Popover>
```

{render('./placement')}

## Commonly Asked Questions

### Resolving popover content cut-off with `PopperProps`

By default, the `Popover` component positions the popover relative to its parent container. In some cases, the popover content might be cut off when it extends outside the container that holds it.

To address this issue, you can pass `PopperProps={{ usePortal: true }}` to `PopoverContent` to make it positioned on the document root.

{render('./faq-use-portal')}

### Automatically adjusting popover placement with the `flip` modifier

The `flip` modifier is a useful feature that allows for automatic adjustment of popover placement when it is at risk of overflowing the specified boundary. To learn more about utilizing the `flip` modifier, please refer to [Popper.js documentation](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/flip/).

In the following example, the popover's placement is initially set to `top`. However, if the placement is not suitable due to space constraints, the opposite `bottom` placement will be used instead.

{render('./faq-flip-modifier')}

## Accessibility

### Keyboard and focus

The `Popover` component includes several accessibility features to ensure that it is usable with a keyboard and assistive technologies:

* When the `Popover` is opened, the focus is automatically moved to the `PopoverContent` element. If the `initialFocusRef` prop is set, then the focus is moved to the element with the specified reference.

* When the `Popover` is closed, the focus returns to the trigger element by default. If the `returnFocusOnClose` prop is set to `false`, the focus will not return to the trigger element.

* If the trigger prop is set to `'hover'`, the `Popover` can be opened by focusing on or mousing over the trigger element, and closed by blurring or mousing out of the trigger element. If the mouse is moved into the `PopoverContent` element, the `Popover` remains visible.

* If the trigger prop is set to `'click'`, the `Popover` can be opened by clicking on the trigger element or pressing the **Space** or **Enter** key when the trigger element has focus. The `Popover` can be closed by clicking on the trigger element again.

* The `Popover` can also be closed by hitting the **Esc** key when the `PopoverContent` element has focus, unless the `closeOnEsc` prop is set to `false`.

* Clicking outside or blurring out of the `PopoverContent` element also closes the `Popover`, unless the `closeOnBlur` prop is set to `false`.

### ARIA attributes

* If the `trigger` is set to `click`, the `role` of the `PopoverContent` element is set to `dialog`.

* If the `trigger` is set to `hover`, the `role` of the `PopoverContent` element is set to `tooltip`.

* `PopoverContent` has `aria-labelledby` set to the `id` attribute of `PopoverHeader`.

* `PopoverContent` has `aria-describedby` set to the `id` attribute of `PopoverBody`.

* `PopoverContent` has `aria-hidden` set to `true` or `false` depending on the open/closed state of `Popover`.

* The trigger has `aria-haspopup` set to `dialog` to denote the popup is a dialog.

* The trigger has `aria-controls` set to the `id` attribute of `PopoverContent` to associate the popover with the trigger.

* The trigger has `aria-expanded` set to `true` or `false` depending on the open/closed state of the popover.
