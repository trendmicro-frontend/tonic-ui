# Accordion

Accordion is a container that allows the user to toggle sections of related content.

## Import

```js
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionHeader, // composed of `AccordionToggle` and `AccordionToggleIcon`
  AccordionBody, // composed of `AccordionContent`
  AccordionToggle,
  AccordionToggleIcon,
  AccordionContent,
} from '@tonic-ui/react';
```

## Usage

### Basic accordion

To compose an accordion with default styles, you can use `Accordion`, `AccordionItem`, `AccordionHeader`, and `AccordionBody` directly.

{render('./basic')}

### Controlled accordion

Extend the default behavior to create an accordion with controlled state.

{render('./controlled')}

### Customization

If you don't like the default styles, you can use `AccordionToggle`, `AccordionToggleIcon`, and `AccordionContent` to customize the accordion.

Here is an example of customizing the accordion:

{render('./customization')}

| disabled | boolean | | Whether the accordion item is disabled. |
| isExpanded | boolean | | Whether the accordion item is expanded. |
| defaultIsExpanded | boolean | | Whether the accordion item is expanded by default. |
| onToggle | function | | A callback that is called when the accordion item is toggled. |

### AccordionHeader

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |
| children | ReactNode | | |
| disabled | boolean | | Whether the accordion header is disabled. |

### AccordionBody

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |
| children | ReactNode | | |

### AccordionToggle

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |
| children | ReactNode | | |
| disabled | boolean | | Whether the accordion toggle is disabled. |
| onClick | function | | A callback that is called when the accordion toggle is clicked. |

### AccordionToggleIcon

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :------ | :---------- |
| appear | boolean | false | By default the child component does not perform the enter transition when it first mounts, regardless of the value of `in`. If you want this behavior, set both `appear` and `in` to true. |
| children | ReactNode \| `(state, props) => ReactNode` | | A function child can be used instead of a React element. This function is called with the current transition state ('entering', 'entered', 'exiting', 'exited'), ref, style, and context specific props for a component. |
| disabled | boolean | | Whether the accordion toggle icon is disabled. |
| easing | string \| `{ enter?: string, exit?: string }` | `{ enter: easing.easeInOut, exit: easing.easeInOut }` | The timing function that describes how intermediate values are calculated during a transition. You may specify a single timing function for all transitions, or individually with an object. |
| in | boolean | | If `true`, the component will transition in. |
| mountOnEnter | boolean | | If `true`, it will "lazy mount" the component on the first `in={true}`. After the first enter transition the component will stay mounted, even on the 'exited' state, unless you also specify `unmountOnExit`. By default the child component is mounted immediately along with the parent transition component. |
| timeout | number \| `{ appear?: number, enter?: number, exit?: number }` | `{ enter: duration.enterScreen, exit: duration.levingScreen }` | The duration for the transition, in milliseconds. You may specify a single timeout for all transitions, or individually with an object. |
| unmountOnExit | boolean | | If `true`, it will unmount the child component when `in={false}` and the animation has finished. By default the child component stays mounted after it reaches the 'exited' state. |

| children | ReactNode | | |
| TransitionComponent | ElementType | Collapse | The component used for the transition. |
| TransitionProps | object | | Props applied to the [Transition](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition#Transition-props) element. |
| TransitionProps.appear | boolean | false | |
