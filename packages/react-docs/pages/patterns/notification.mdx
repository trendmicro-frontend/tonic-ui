# Notification

## Overview

Notifications proactively provide short, timely, and relevant information about the product to help users notice important things and even take follow-up actions.

You can use the following channels to notify users:

* Notification center:
  * Informative
  * Tasks
* Alert
  * Product-level alert
  * In-app alert
* Toast
  * Bread
  * Toast

## How It Works

### Notification center

Product-level system notifications can be placed on the Informative tab of the notification center with the following types:
* Success: Indicates that a system task is successfully executed.
* Error: Indicates that a system error occurs and requires users to take actions.
* Information: Indicates that a system change happens and might temporarily affect users, for example, system maintenance.
* Attack related: Informs users of attack related information and leads users to learn about the impact.
* New feature: Informs users of a new feature and leads users to learn more about the feature.

{render('./NotificationCenter')}

Notifications about user-initiated system tasks that require some time to complete can be placed on the **Tasks** tab of the notification center. A notification is triggered when the task status changes.
A task can have the following statuses:
* Task successful: Informs users that a task is successfully executed. You can add a shortcut button to guide users to take follow-up actions. For example, adding a **Download** button when a file is ready to be exported.
* Request pending: Informs users that a task requires manual approval.
* Task unsuccessful: Informs users that a task fails to be executed and leads users to the corresponding screen to view an error message that explain the failure.

### Alert

#### Product-level alert

For product-level alerts, place an alert banner above the product name bar. The alert can be dismissed manually by the user or automatically by the system after the call to action is completed.
An alert has the following types:
* Error: Informs users that a problem has occurred, for example, license expiration, and requires users to take actions.
* Warning: Informs users to prevent an imminent problem, for example, license about to expire.

For more information, see [license notification handling]().

#### In-app alert

For alerts that are related to a screen or a feature only, show the alert banner in the associated screen or feature. The alert can be placed in different modules to fit different use cases. For example, place it in the upper part of a screen, a drawer, or a modal.
An in-app alert has the following types:
* Promotion: Used only when there is a solution or offering to promote.
* Error: Informs users that a problem has occurred and requires users to take actions.
* Warning:
  - Informs users of a potential problem that may not require immediate actions.
  - Informs users to prevent an imminent problem.
* Information: Provides useful, relevant information to users.

### Bread

Use bread only on limited space such as modal and drawer. Place a bread between the space title and the content.
A bread has the following types:
*  Success: The bread is dismissed automatically in 5 seconds.
* Error/warning: The bread remains there until dismissed by the user.
After the limited space is closed, the bread is automatically dismissed.

### Toast

Toast provides simple feedback for user-initiated actions or information that users need to complete the current task. Place a toast on the bottom right of a screen. Toasts can be chronologically piled up when there are multiple and pushed down when a previous toast is dismissed.
A toast has the following types:
* Success: The toast is dismissed automatically in 5 seconds.
* Error/warning: The toast remains there until dismissed by the user.
