# Migration From v1 to v2

⚠️ This is the Tonic UI migration guide for upgrading from v1 to v2. You have to consider whether you will do the upgrade if the breaking changes are not acceptable to you at the moment.

## Upgrade Steps

### 1. Update the dependencies

```diff
  "dependencies": {
+   "@tonic-ui/react": "^2.0.0",
+   "@tonic-ui/react-icons": "^2.0.0"
  }
```

### 2. Update the import location for icon components

In Tonic UI v2, icon components must be imported separately from the `@tonic-ui/react-icons` package.

The diff should look like below:

```diff
  import { Badge, Icon } from '@tonic-ui/react';
+ import { AlertIcon } from '@tonic-ui/react-icons';
  import React from 'react';

  export default () => (
    <Badge variant="dot">
-     <Icon icon="alert" size="4x" />
+     <Icon as={AlertIcon} size="4x" />
    </Badge>
  );
```

To apply this change across your project, run the following command:

```bash
npx @tonic-ui/codemod@latest react/v2.0.0/import-react-icons <path>
```
