# CSS Variables

## Overview

Tonic UI has a default behavior of internally converting theme tokens defined in the theme to CSS variables.

For example, consider a theme object that looks like this:

```js disabled
const theme = {
  colors: {
    'gray:10': '#fafafa',
    'gray:20': '#f7f7f7',
  },
};
```

When this theme is passed to `TonicProvider`, Tonic UI will generate CSS variables automatically, as shown below:

```css
:root {
  --tonic-colors-gray-10: #fafafa;
  --tonic-colors-gray-20: #f7f7f7;
}
```

These CSS variables can then be used to style components, providing a consistent look and feel throughout the application.

## Default CSS Variables

If you want to see all the CSS variables being used on the webpage, you can open the **Developer Tools** and go to the **Elements** tab. There, you will be able to view all the default CSS variables.

{render('./default-css-variables')}
