# Contributing to Documentation Site

Visit [this page](../contributing#set-up-documentation-site) for instructions on setting up the development environment for the documentation site.

## Overview

Let's get started by exploring the `pages` directory, following the Next.js convention where each file represents a route in the application. Note that page extensions should be either `.page.js` or `.page.mdx`; otherwise, they will be treated as non-page files. You can configure these extensions in `next.config.js`.

### Pages directory structure

Name | Description
:--- | :----------
404.page.js | Handles the 404 error page, displayed when a route is not found.
_app.page.js | A custom `App` component that controls the page initialization and creates a shared layout between page changes.
_document.page.js | A custom `Document` component that allows you to modify the initial HTML document structure. You can configure the `<html>` and `<body>` tags, set up meta tags, or add scripts and styles necessary for server-side rendering.
