# The sx prop

The `sx` prop is a useful shortcut for defining custom styles with access to the theme. It offers a comprehensive set of CSS functions provided by `@tonic-ui/styled-system`, including child and pseudo-selectors, media queries, raw CSS values, and more.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following package versions to use the `sx` prop:

Package Name | Release Version
:-- | :--
`@tonic-ui/react` | [1.18.0](https://github.com/trendmicro-frontend/tonic-ui/releases/tag/%40tonic-ui%2Freact%401.18.0) or higher
`@tonic-ui/styled-system` | [1.7.0](https://github.com/trendmicro-frontend/tonic-ui/releases/tag/%40tonic-ui%2Fstyled-system%401.7.0) or higher

## Usage

To get started with the `sx` prop, check out the demo below. It shows how to pass style and pseudo-style props to your components, allowing you to create custom styles with ease.

### Creating a custom button

{render('./creating-a-custom-button')}

### Defining CSS custom properties (CSS variables)

{render('./defining-css-custom-properties')}

### Using media queries

{render('./using-media-queries')}

### Callback values

Each property in the `sx` prop can receive a function callback as a value. This is useful when you want to use the `theme` for calculating a value:

```jsx disabled
<Box sx={{ color: (theme) => theme.sizes['2x'] }} />
```

### Array values

Array types are useful when you want to partially override some styles in the former index:

{render('./array-of-objects')}

Each index can be an object or a callback:

{render('./array-of-callbacks')}

### Passing the `sx` prop

If you want to pass the `sx` prop from a custom component and pass it down to Tonic UI components, we recommend this approach:

{render('./passing-the-sx-prop')}
