# useHydrated

A custom Hook that returns a boolean indicating if the component is hydrated.

- When doing Server-Side Rendering (SSR), the result will always be `false`.
- When doing Client-Side Rendering (CSR), the result will always be `false` on the first render, and `true` on subsequent renders.

## Import

```js
import { useHydrated } from '@tonic-ui/react-hooks';
```

## Usage

```jsx
function Component() {
  const isHydrated = useHydrated();

  return (
    <>
      {isHydrated ? 'Hydrated' : 'Not hydrated'}
    </>
  );
}
```
