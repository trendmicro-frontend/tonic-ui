# Breakpoints

To configure the default breakpoints used in responsive array values, add a
breakpoints array to your theme. These values will be used to generate
mobile-first (i.e. min-width) media queries, which can then be used to apply
responsive styles. 

> The `breakpoints` array is used at breakpoints theme scale.

> For example, you can write `<Box fontSize={["xs", "sm"]}/>` to make the font size responsive.

<ThemeParser theme="breakpoints" />

```jsx
// responsive font size
<Box fontSize={["xs", "sm", "md", "lg"]}>Breakpoints</Box>
```

## Configuration Reference

Except for breakpoints, colors, and spacing, all keys in the theme object map to one of the core themes. All keys can be replaced or extended.
