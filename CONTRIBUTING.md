## Contributing to Documentation

To contribute the documentation, you can run a local server with `yarn dev` in the `packages/react-docs` directory. Be sure to run `yarn build` in advance before running the server.

```bash
# Build the workspace
yarn build
```

```bash
# Run the server
cd packages/react-docs
yarn dev
```

You can now access the site locally at `http://localhost:3000`. Changes to the docs will be reflected in the build.

To update React components, go to `packages/react` and run `yarn build`, it will reload the site with the new changes.

```bash
# Update React components
cd packages/react
yarn build
```
